Personal Website
================

Visit [sathyamvellal.in][1]

#### Note:
This website is not worth forking right now as it contains a lot of changes from jekyll-bootstrap which are hard to track.  
The website is still new, currently under pre-release era; the latest being RC2. Checkout [releases][2]. The 1st full release will be forkable and much friendlier for your own modifications.  
For now, you can fork and watch the progress.
